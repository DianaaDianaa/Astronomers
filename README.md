# Astronomers
The project is a desktop application that allows users- astronomers- to view information about celestial objects such as stars, and constellations. 
The application is built using C++. The main features of the application include the ability to browse through a gallery of information 
about celestial objects, update specific objects, and save new objects to a personal list. The Astronomers project provides a GUI interface.
